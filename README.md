## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach

We tested and compared several classification models including:

- Decision Trees
- Support Vector Machines
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- **Logistic Regression (Selected Model)**

After evaluating based on accuracy, interpretability, and performance, **Logistic Regression** was selected as the final model for its balance of simplicity and effectiveness.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. User answers a short quiz
2. Responses are sent to the backend
3. Data is processed using pandas and numpy
4. Pre-trained logistic regression model predicts results
5. The website displays a personalized insight
